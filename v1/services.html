            Web development refers to the process of building and maintaining websites and web applications. It encompasses a wide range of tasks, including web design, web content development, client-side/server-side scripting, network security configuration, and more.
            
            Here are some key aspects of web development:
            
            Front-end Development: This involves creating the visual and interactive parts of a website that users see and interact with directly in their web browsers. It typically involves HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as frameworks/libraries like React, Angular, or Vue.js.
            
            Back-end Development: This focuses on the server-side of web applications, where the logic, database interactions, and server configuration take place. Popular back-end technologies include Node.js, Ruby on Rails, Django, and PHP.
            
            Full-stack Development: Developers who work on both the front-end and back-end of a website or application are referred to as full-stack developers. They have skills in both areas and can handle the entire development process.
